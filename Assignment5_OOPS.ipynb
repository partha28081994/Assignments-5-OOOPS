    "The five key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Encapsulation\n",
    "\n",
    "Definition: Encapsulation involves bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, typically a class. It also restricts direct access to some components of an object to protect data integrity.\n",
    "Benefits:\n",
    "Hides internal implementation details (data hiding).\n",
    "Promotes modularity and prevents unauthorized access.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Abstraction\n",
    "    \n",
    "Definition: Abstraction hides complexity by exposing only the essential features of an object while concealing the implementation details.\n",
    "Benefits:\n",
    "Simplifies the user interface.\n",
    "Focuses on what an object does rather than how it does it.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "Definition: Inheritance allows a class (child or subclass) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (parent or superclass). This promotes code reuse and establishes a relationship between classes.\n",
    "Benefits:\n",
    "Reduces code duplication.\n",
    "Enables hierarchical classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Polymorphism\n",
    "    \n",
    "Definition: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It provides a unified interface for different data types or class implementations.\n",
    "Benefits:\n",
    "Enhances flexibility and maintainability.\n",
    "Simplifies method invocation across different objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Composition\n",
    "\n",
    "Definition: Composition involves creating complex objects by combining simpler ones.\n",
    "Benefits:\n",
    "Promotes modularity.\n",
    "Offers flexibility by allowing changes to individual components without affecting the entire system."
